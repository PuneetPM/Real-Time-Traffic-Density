# Real-Time-Traffic-Density


## Traffic Density Estimation using YOLOv8

This project leverages YOLOv8 for real-time Traffic Density Estimation, crucial for urban and traffic management. The goal is to count vehicles within specific areas in each frame to assess traffic density, aiding in identifying peak traffic periods and congested zones, and assisting in urban planning.

## Object Detection Overview

Object detection involves locating and identifying objects in images or videos. Outputs include bounding boxes around objects, class labels, and confidence scores, making it suitable for identifying object locations without needing detailed shapes. Leading models include RCNNs, SSDs, and YOLO, with YOLO currently excelling in balancing speed and accuracy, especially for real-time detection.

## YOLO: A Real-Time Object Detection Revolution

YOLO, or "You Only Look Once," revolutionizes object detection by combining localization and classification into a single step. This approach allows YOLO to achieve real-time, accurate image and video processing. The latest version, YOLOv8, further enhances this technology, making it highly effective for real-time object detection and image segmentation applications.

## YOLOv8: Advancing Object Detection

Launched in January 2023 by Ultralytics, YOLOv8 is the latest in the YOLO series. It excels in classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, surpassing YOLOv7 in speed and accuracy. Using Darknet53 as its backbone, YOLOv8 employs more feature maps and efficient CNNs, achieving higher mAP and fps. It introduces an anchor-free detection head for pixel-wise bounding box estimation and a new loss function, achieving a mean Average Precision of 53.7% on the COCO benchmark.

## Traffic Density Estimation Project Overview
